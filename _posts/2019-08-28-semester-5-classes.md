I've just recently begun my junior year of university, and I wanted to post an update on the classes that I'm currently enrolled in!

- Software Engineering
<p>Perhaps the most hands-on course offered at the University of Florida, Intro to Software Engineering bears a strong resemblance to the kind of work I did this summer at Haneke Design. In this class, we are all put into groups of four and given a project to complete for real companies. Throughout the semester, we have to use the Agile methodology to keep up with our clients and ultimately ship them a working product by the end of the year. I can't wait to see what we build!</p>

- Engineering Statistics
<p>Engineering Statistics is an introductory statistics course taught with an emphasis on applications to the many branches of engineering. While this class is a requirement for completing the Computer Science Bachelor Degree in the College of Engineering, I am also taking it as an experential taste of the field of data science. I still love numbers, and I'm very interested in pursuing an internship in data science to see if it's something I'd enjoy doing.</p>

- Numerical Analysis
<p>Numerical Analysis is a math-intensive course that delves into the mathematical principles and ideologies behind many of the most common algorithms today. This class is crucial to computer science students, as we are perfectly set up to convert everything we learn into functional computer programs.</p>

- Financial Accounting
<p>Financial Accounting is a course that falls on the track for my Business Administration minor. This is the first accounting class that most students take at the University of Florida, and it has strong real-world benefits. Throughout the year, we will learn all about financial statements and how to approach decisions on investment.</p>

- Neuroanatomy
<p>A one-credit Honors Read course, Intro to Neuroanatomy takes a fascinating look at the human brain. Over the course of the semester, we will learn key terminology about the brain's anatomy, what separates our brain apart from those of other animals, and how our brain has evolved over time. This class will be an enjoyable break from the math-intensive curricula of my other courses, and I can't wait to dive into it.</p>

Look out for more updates in the future on how my courses are going and what I'm up to next!

[Burger Builder][burger-builder] is my first run at creating a website using some of the most modern features of React. Though it is still a work in progress, it includes features like hooks, routing, API requests, toolbars, and modal popups. The project follows along with Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy series called ["React - The Complete Guide"][react-complete-guide].

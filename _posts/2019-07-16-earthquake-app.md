[Earthquake][earthquake-app] was my first free-handed take at an iOS App, built to run on the iPhone 8. It reaches out to the U.S. Geological Survey's database on earthquakes and displays the data in an ordered list. Additionally, every earthquake can be selected to display more information, including a map of where the Earthquake hit and a distance from the user of the app. I also implemented a scroll-to-refresh functionality, as well as an external link back to the USGS website.

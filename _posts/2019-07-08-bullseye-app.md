[Bull's Eye][bullseye-app] served as my introduction to building iOS Apps in Swift. It is a tutorial-based application offered by Ray Wenderlich at [this site][rays-site]. The goal of the game is to move a slider to as close to a target value as possible. The app introduces many of Swift's fundamental, like the separation of logic from effects and the ability to push pages onto a view stack.

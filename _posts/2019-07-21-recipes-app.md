[Recipes][recipes-app] was the first app I attempted to build entirely off my own inspiration. It is a simply formatted app that allows you to enter a recipe's name, ingredients, picture, and the date when you learned about it. Building this app allowed me to dip my toes into some new features of Swift, including the ability to access a user's cameral roll and the ability to persist data in between sessions.

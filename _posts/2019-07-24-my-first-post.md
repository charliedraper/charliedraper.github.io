At long last, I've decided to create a blog. I'm not yet sure what kind of treasures it will hold. Perhaps a review of new technical discoveries. Maybe a retelling of my challenges and accomplishments.
Or, most likely of all, a catalog of the ramblings of my mind while I try to fall asleep at night. Either way, this is sure to be a treat. In the mean time, get to know a litte bit [about me][about]!
